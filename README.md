# brickbot
Brickbot is a discord bot that reacts to messages containing the word 'brick' with the :brick: emoji. It does some other stuff, but that's really the main point.

If you want to add Brickbot to your own server, the invite link is:

https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=819688841527033927&permissions=265280&scope=bot

Though I can't guarantee that it'll be up all the time (in fact she is often offline...).
